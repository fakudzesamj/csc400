D0 CF 11 E0 A1 B1 1A E1	 	ÐÏ.à¡±.á
DOC, DOT, PPS, PPT, XLA, XLS, WIZ	 	An Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) Compound File (CF) (i.e., OLECF)
file format, known as Compound Binary File format by Microsoft, used by
Microsoft Office 97-2003 applications (Word, Powerpoint, Excel, Wizard). Part of
Microsoft's Structured Storage (MSS) architecture for Component Object Model (COM)-based
operating systems.
[See also Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, and Word "subheaders" at byte offset 512 (0x200).]
There appear to several subheader formats and a dearth of documentation.
There have been reports that there are different subheaders for Windows and Mac
versions of MS Office but I cannot confirm that.]
Password-protected DOCX, XLSX, and PPTX files also use this signature those files
are saved as OLECF files.
[Note the similarity between D0 CF 11 E0 and the word "DOCFILE"!]
